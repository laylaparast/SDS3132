# **1. Dataset Information**

The __shelter.csv__ dataset contains variables collected from adult cats and dogs that were adopted at the Austin Animal shelter over the course of one month.

First, you'll want to import in the dataset (note that the default working directory is the folder in which this .Rmd file is located):

```{r}
shelter <- read.csv('shelter.csv')
```

Let's get a summary of the variables:

```{r}
summary(shelter)
```

# **2. Making Tables**

You can create a table manually like the example below, which describes the variables in this dataset:

 Variable | Description
--------|------------------------------------------------------
ID | Unique identifier
Intake.Type | How animal arrived at the shelter
Species | Dog or cat
Sex | Female or male
Age.Intake | Age (years) at intake
Condition | Animal's health condition 
Intake.Weight | Weight (lbs) at intake
Adopted.Weight | Weight (lbs) at adoption
Days.to.Adoption | Days spent in the shelter



# **3. Code and Output**

Code is run linearly (dependent on what is run above):

```{r}
mean(shelter$Days.to.Adoption)
```

You can suppress the code:

```{r echo=FALSE}
mean(shelter$Days.to.Adoption)
```

You can also suppress the output:

```{r results='hide'}
mean(shelter$Days.to.Adoption)
```


# **4. Graphs and Embedding Code**

On average, animals spent `r mean(shelter$Days.to.Adoption)` days before being adopted.

```{r}
# Make a histogram of days to adopt variable
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(shelter, aes(x=Days.to.Adoption)) +  geom_histogram(binwidth=10, col='black', fill='maroon') + xlab('Number of Days to Adoption') + ggtitle('Distribution of Days to Adoption') + theme_classic()
```
